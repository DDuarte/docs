## Register to the shell

If you want to integrate services or applications from an image into the shell, use the `register` command. This will create Start Menu shortcuts and file associations in the Windows shell similar to an installed application.

```
# Register 7-zip to the shell
> spoon register spoonbrew/7zip
```

Configuring shortcuts and file associations is done in the IDE. See the [reference](/docs/reference#ide) section for more details.
