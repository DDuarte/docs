## MSI

MSI outputs simply wrap the portable exe into an MSI package to add support for shell integrations such as file associations, Start Menu shortcuts and ProgIds. MSIs are a common deployment option for organizations that are using AdminStudio or for integrating with existing desktop management solutions. See the [reference](/docs/reference) for details on MSI settings.

To build an MSI, go to the **Setup** section of the IDE, enter the MSI details and click **Build MSI**. MSIs can be deployed with existing desktop management tools or directly by the end users. 

An enterprise license for the IDE is required to enable MSI outputs. Contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@spoon.net) for more information.
