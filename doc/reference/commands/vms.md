### vms

The vms command lists all versions of the Spoon VM available to the current user. 

If a user is logged in to the Spoon IDE, all versions available both locally and on the remote registry are displayed. 

If no user is logged in to the Spoon IDE, only locally-stored versions of the Spoon VM are displayed.
