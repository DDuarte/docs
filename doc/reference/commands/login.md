### login

The `login` command logs a user into a remote Spoon server. 

When run without parameters, the `login` command will return the logged-in user's username and time of log in or the message **You are not currently logged in**, if a user is not logged in. 

If a user is already logged in, the `login` command will automatically log that user out and log the new user in.
