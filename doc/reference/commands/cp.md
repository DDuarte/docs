# cp

The `cp` command is used to copy a file from a container to the native file system. 

The path of the file or directory to copy must be *absolute*, or the `cp` command will fail. 

The path of the local destination for the copied file/directory may be a relative path. The path is taken relative to the current directory in the local command prompt.
