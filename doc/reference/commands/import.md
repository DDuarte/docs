# import

The `import` command is used to copy a Spoon image from an arbitrary location on your local machine (or network) to your local registry.

This command is most useful for users building applications with the Spoon IDE's GUI. Since images built in this program are not automatically added to the local registry, they must be imported before they can be accessed from the Spoon IDE's command line interface. 

Similarly, users of **Spoon Virtual Application Studio**, can use this command to `import` existing `.svm` files into their local registry. 

**Note**: Only valid Spoon images (`.svm` files) can be imported to the local registry.
