# pull

The `pull` command copies an image from a remote registry to your local registry. 

This command requires a single parameter: the image that you wish to pull. The remote registry that will be pulled from is specified as part of the Spoon IDE configuration settings (see [config](TODO: add link)). 

The image to pull can be specified with up to 3 identifiers, only 1 of which (the name) is mandatory: 

- Namespace
- Name
- Tag
