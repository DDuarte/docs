## Account Basics

[Sign up](http://spoon.net/sso/spoonium.net/register) for a Spoonium account to get started, or log in with your existing [Spoon.net](http://spoon.net) account information. If you can't access your account, you can [reset your password](http://spoon.net/password-reset) at any time. 

To support open-source projects, every Spoonium account comes with unlimited public repositories on the Spoonium Hub, as well as a ton of other features. Public repositories let any Spoonium account holder pull or run your project. Private repositories with named users require purchase of an [upgraded plan](http://spoonium.net/pricing). 

## Organizations

Organization accounts are available as a [free upgrade](http://spoonium.net/pricing) for groups of collaborators working together on any number of projects.

Organization homepages are located at **http://spoonium.net/orgs/[your org name]** and list all of the organization's members and repositories. 

Whichever account creates the organization is the **owner**. Owners can add or remove other users and manage the organization's subscription. These actions can be done from the organization's setting page, located at **http://spoonium.net/orgs/[your org name]/settings**. 

Similar to individual accounts, organizations may host unlimited public repositories on the Spoonium Hub. Private repositories are available for organizations with [paid plans](http://spoonium.net/pricing).
