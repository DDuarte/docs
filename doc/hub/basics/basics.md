## Account Basics

You can sign up for a Spoonium account with any valid email address [here](https://spoon.net/sso/spoonium.net/register). 

[Spoon.net](http://spoon.net) users can use their existing account on the Spoonium Hub. 

If you can't access your account, you can reset your password from the [password reset form](http://spoon.net/password-reset). 

All accounts on Spoonium come with *unlimited* public repositories on the Spoonium Hub. Private repositories require purchase of an [upgraded plan](http://spoonium.net). 

## Organizations

Organization accounts are available for groups of collaborators for a single project. 

To create a new organization, log in to your Spoonium account and navigate to the [pricing page](http://spoonium.net/pricing). On the *Organization* tab, select the desired account level. 

Organization homepages are located at http://spoonium.net/orgs/[org name]. This page lists all of the organization's members and repositories. 

Whichever account creates the organization is the *owner*. Owners can add or remove other users and manage the organization's subscription. These actions can be done from the organization's setting page, located at http://spoonium.net/orgs/[org name]/settings. 

Similar to individual accounts, organizations may host unlimited public repositories on the Spoonium Hub. Private repositories are available for organizations with [upgraded plans](http://spoonium.net/pricing).
