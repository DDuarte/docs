The distribution component of Spoonium is the [hub](http://spoonium.net/hub). The public hub serves as the remote registry where you can upload and share your images and projects.

## Accounts

To begin using the hub, [sign up](http://spoon.net/sso/spoonium.net/register) for a Spoonium account or log in with your existing [Spoon.net](http://spoon.net) account information.

All Spoonium accounts come with unlimited public repositories on the Spoonium Hub. Private repositories with named users are available with [paid plans](/pricing). 

### Organizations

For groups of collaborators working together on projects, we offer organization accounts as a [free upgrade](/pricing).

The owner (creator) of the organization can add or remove users and manage the organization's subscription from the settings page: **http://spoonium.net/orgs/[org name]/settings**.

Similar to individual accounts, organizations may host unlimited public repositories, and private repositories are available with [paid plans](/pricing).
