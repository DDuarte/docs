The [Hub](http://spoonium.net/hub) is the distribution component of Spoonium. It is a repository where you can store and share images that you have created. All Spoonium accounts come with unlimited public repositories and it's easy to [upgrade](/pricing) to create private repositories.

## Creating a Profile

To use the Hub, you need a profile! [Sign up](http://spoon.net/sso/spoonium.net/register) for a Spoonium account or log in with your existing Spoon.net account information.

Once your account is created, go to your [account settings](/account) to add your avatar, Twitter URL and GitHub URL.

### Are you working with a team?

If you are working with a group of collaborators, [create an organization](/pricing#organization) to simplify the management of the repository.

The owner of the organization can add or remove users and manage the organization's subscription from the [settings](/hub) page.

Similar to individual accounts, organizations may have unlimited public repositories, and can [upgrade](/pricing#organization) for private repositories.
