The distribution component of Spoonium is the [hub](http://spoonium.net/hub).

## Creating a Profile

To begin using the hub, [sign up](http://spoon.net/sso/spoonium.net/register) for a Spoonium profile or log in with your existing [Spoon.net](http://spoon.net) profile information.

All Spoonium profiles come with unlimited public repositories on the Spoonium Hub. Private repositories with named users are available with [paid subscriptions](/pricing). 

### Organizations

For groups of collaborators working together on projects, we offer organization profiles as a [free upgrade](/pricing).

The owner (creator) of the organization can add or remove users and manage the organization's subscription from the settings page: **http://spoonium.net/orgs/[org name]/settings**.

Similar to individual profiles, organizations may host unlimited public repositories, and private repositories are available with [paid subscriptions](/pricing).
