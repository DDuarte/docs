## Templates

Templates are a way to build your own application environment. Tell Spoonium what type of application you're building and what it needs to function, and we'll deliver a base container with the proper images embedded within that virtual environment.

For example, let's say you're making a JS web application built on MongoDB and NodeJS. Instead of downloading both individually and forcing your testers and end users to download them as well, you could instead build upon a container template that already has Mongo and Node running within the virtual environment. By packaging your application into that container, you can deploy it to any Windows environment for testing or use without installers, missing dependencies, or breaks.
