## Registries

We need a way to share our images. Spoonium's public [hub](http://spoonium.net/hub) serves as the remote registry where you can upload and share your projects.

All profiles get unlimited public repositories. Once your image has been pushed to the hub, you can run the same container from any other Windows machine.
