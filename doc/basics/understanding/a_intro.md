# Overview

Spoonium works by materializing a virtual environment on the endpoint device, dynamically transferring application components required for execution, capturing application interactions with the storage system into a container, and differentially synchronizing the containerized content back to the cloud.

Spoon's patented technology stack combines application and storage virtualization with innovative web-based network and synchronization protocols, machine learning algorithms, and proprietary semistructured large data storage systems.
