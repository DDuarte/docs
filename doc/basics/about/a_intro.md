# What is Spoonium?

Spoonium is a container platform built on top of the Spoon virtual machine. Spoonium allows developers and systems administrators to isolate their applications from any underlying infrastructure, so that the same application runs the same way on any computer.

The Spoon virtualization machine, or Spoon VM, acts as a lightweight virtualization layer that sits between your application and the operating system. Applications run in a container interact with a virtual filesystem and registry, while the Spoon VM handles internal requests while selectively deferring certain commands to the underlying operating system. The Spoon VM also acts as a compatibility layer, allowing the same application to run the same way on any Windows NT 5.0+ OS.
