## What is Spoonium?

Spoonium is a Windows containerization platform for developers and sysadmins to quickly and reliably build, test, and deploy applications. "Spooned" applications run exactly the same way on any computer - no conflicts, no dependencies, no matter the underlying infrastructure.

#### Made for Developers

Spoonium is a fast and easy way to build and ship unbreakable applications.

With Spoonium, developers can deploy any application to any machine without installers, incompatibilities, or breaks. Packaging applications into containers with their dependencies ensures that applicati ons run as intended wherever they go.

#### Made for QA

Spoonium gives testers a unique way to efficiently test software and report bugs.

By standardizing development and QA environments, containers make reproducing issues and patching bugs a cinch. Any unit or code-level integration tests can be executed within a container, ensuring the environment used in production is properly tested against. Manual testers can pull a container down to their local machine and test against a local copy of the application; they can even run the Spooned application side-by-side against an old version.

Beyond that, Spoonium commands have a variety of uses for QA. For example, `spoon revert` "turns back time" by reverting your container to a fresh image whenever you want to run a new test; you can even change the state of the app back to a specific point in time.

For web applications, Spoonium also offers unlimited manual and automated browser testing.

#### Made for DevOps

Spoonium standardizes, simplifies, and speeds up software distribution.

Containers revolutionize the shipping process. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a container, sysadmins take away the inconsistencies between staging and production environments, allowing their teams to quickly and routinely ship to production.

Additionally, using Spoonium as a deployment standard massively simplifies getting software to end users. Instead of traditional installation with multiple points of failure, end users can run any Spooned application straight from their command prompt, or directly from the web in one click via the [Spoonium Hub](http://spoonium.net/hub) - even if they don't have the required dependencies.

#### Made for open source

Spoonium is 100% free for public projects. [Contact us](http://spoonium.net/contact) to get set up.
