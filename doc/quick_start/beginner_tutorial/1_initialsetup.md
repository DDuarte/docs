# Initial Setup and Configuration

Before getting started with Spoonium, you'll need to: 

1. Create an account on [Spoonium](http://spoonium.net). If you do not already have an account, you can sign up for one [here](https://spoon.net/sso/spoonium.net/register). **Note**: Existing Spoon.net accounts can be used on Spoonium. 
2. Download and install the Spoon Plugin. The Spoon Plugin can be downloaded from [http://start.spoon.net/install](http://start.spoon.net/install). Once downloaded, run the executable to install the plugin. 
3. Upon successful installation, a login dialog will appear. Log in using your Spoonium credentials. 
4. Verify the plugin was installed properly. To do this: 
	1. Open a new command prompt (Start Menu > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt)
	2. Type `spoon`. The `Spoon IDE` help dialog should appear. 

Once you've verified that the plugin was installed properly, you're ready to get started! 

## Login

At this time, you should have a command prompt open and the Spoon Plugin installed. 

Before beginning, you'll need to log into the Spoonium Hub using your Spoonium/Spoon.net credentials.
