<!--TODO: revise all this when the new templating goes into place for these tools -->

#### Browser Sandbox

The Spoonium.net Browser Sandbox makes cross-browser testing and backwards compatibility easy. Just click Run for any browser to launch it instantly.

Browsers run within an isolated virtual environment, eliminating the need for installs and allowing legacy browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 to run on Windows 7 and 8.

Virtualized browsers behave exactly like installed browsers. And because they run locally, you can test web applications hosted on your own development machine or on internal servers. Simply launch the browser from Spoon.net or the Spoon Console and enter your test URL in the navigation bar.

Spoon.net supports standard browser components like Java applets and ActiveX controls as well as popular browser plugins like Firebug, IE Developer Toolbar, and CSS and JavaScript debugging consoles.
