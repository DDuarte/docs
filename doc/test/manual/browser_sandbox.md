## Browser Sandbox

[http://spoonium.net/manual](http://spoonium.net/manual)

**Summary**

Browser Sandbox is a powerful tool for cross-browser and backwards compatibility testing. Just click **RUN** to launch any browser straight from the web page.

**How it works**

Browsers run within isolated virtual containers with all required dependencies. This eliminates the need for installs and allows legacy browsers like IE 6 to run on newer operating systems like Windows 7 and 8.

**Usage**

You can run any amount of browsers side-by-side without conflict, and we set no limits on hours of usage or number of concurrent tests. Launch IE 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 alongside one another - it will make your life much easier.

**Behavior**

Virtualized browsers behave exactly like installed browsers, and because they execute locally, you can test web applications hosted on your own development machine or internal servers.

**Security**

Rather than accessing browsers in a far-away server operated by Spoon, Spoonium works by delivering browsers in virtual containers that execute on the local machine. The browser uses local resources and runs on the test machine's network. No traffic is ever transmitted over Spoon's servers or network.

**Speed**

Because our delivery model is completely different than other testing services, you don't have to worry about wait times or test queues. Spoonium browsers launch in seconds, even over slow network connections.

**Browser Components**

Spoonium supports standard browser components like Java applets and ActiveX controls, as well as popular browser plugins like Firebug, IE Developer Toolbar, and CSS and JavaScript debugging consoles.
