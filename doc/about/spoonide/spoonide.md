## IDE and Command Line

The IDE, previously known as **Spoon Studio**, allows developers and systems administrators to build Spoon images through a friendly graphical user interface. The IDE is most commonly used for it's "snapshot" method of containerization. Read more about IDE [here](/docs/reference#ide).

The command line interface (CLI) is a command line tool for creating containers and building images in real-time. The CLI also provides a suite of tools for managing containers and images.

**Developers** can use the CLI to containerize their entire developer stack into their application -- ensuring that the same product a developer sees is the one encountered by end-users.

**System administrators** can use the CLI to more effectively manage their infrastructure.
