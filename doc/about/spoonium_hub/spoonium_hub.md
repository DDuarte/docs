The [Spoonium Hub](http://spoonium.net/hub) is a public, SaaS platform for hosting and distributing Spoon images. 

**Repositories** on the hub host the images for a single project or product. For example, all of the trusted .NET images can be found under the spoonbrew/dotNet repository. 

Within a repository exists the entire version history of that project. Users can instantly pull or run the latest version of the project or rewind through the project's history and run a legacy version. 

Repositories may be public *or* private. All Spoonium accounts come with *unlimited* public repositories while private repositories require a paid account. 

**Why Use the Spoonium Hub?**

Because it will make your life much, much easier!

The hub can serve as an endpoint for end-user deployment as well as a hub for internal development. New application releases can be pushed to a public repository, where they can be run by your end-users with the click of a button. 

Internal and pre-release builds can, meanwhile, be held in private repositories where they can only be accessed by the members of your organization. When a build is ready for release, simply `spoon push` it to a public repository and deployment is done!
