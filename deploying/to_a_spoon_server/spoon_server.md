## To a Spoon Server

For organizations that have an on-premise Spoon Server, Spoon Studio provides a feature to deploy applications directly to the Spoon Server. After completing the build process, see the [Build](/docs/building/working-with-the-ide) section for details, click on the **Publish to Spoon.net** option on the ribbon menu.

You will be prompted to log in to the Spoon Server using the Server Administrator credentials. After logging in and verifying the application information, the application will be added to the Spoon Server. To read more about this process, please refer to the [reference](/docs/reference) section.
