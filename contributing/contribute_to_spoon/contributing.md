## Contribute to Spoon

Welcome to the Spoon community!

All build scripts for Spoon images are open sourced, so please contribute! You're also welcome to edit our Docs if you would like to add or change anything.

During our beta period, users who submit pull requests will be sent a Spoon swag kit filled with shirts, caps, hoodies, and other Spoon gear.

You can contribute **image build scripts** [**here**](https://github.com/spoonapps/spoonme).

You can add and edit **spoon.net/docs** [**here**](https://github.com/spoonapps/docs).

Things we love to see:

- Additions, fixes, or improvements to our tutorials and documentation.
- Build scripts, recipes, and walkthroughs for new images and containers.
- New projects built with Spoon's Windows containers in mind. Like [PowerSpoon](https://github.com/spoonapps/powerspoon), a community-made PowerShell module for our CLI!

If you have an idea for an improvement but lack the time to make a pull request, ping us on our [user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spoon-users), tweet [@spoonapps](http://twitter.com/spoonapps), or email us at [support@spoon.net](mailto:support@spoon.net).
