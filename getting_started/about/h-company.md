### Company

[Spoon.net](http://spoon.net) is a leading developer of software virtualization and container technology. Available as both a web-based service and on-site server, Spoon.net allows software publishers, enterprises, and schools to build, test, deploy, and manage desktop application containers instantly to any user with an Internet connection.

"Spooned" applications run in isolated containers, allowing applications to run side-by-side without conflicts, dependencies, or modifications to the host desktop. Spoon.net's unique hybrid client/server virtualization technology combines the convenience of web-based delivery with the performance and robustness of local execution.

[Spoon Studio](/studio) lets you easily convert both your new and existing applications into virtual applications for deployment in standalone EXEs, on intranets with Spoon Server, or on the web with Spoon.net. Studio has graphical and command-line interfaces for packaging application containers. [Read more](/docs/building) about building containers with Spoon Studio.

[Spoon Server](/server) is an on-site version of Spoon.net that includes powerful management and analytical capabilities. Server allows developers and IT departments to host web portals for testers and end users to access their applications on a private cloud.
