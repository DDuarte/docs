## About

Spoon is a platform for building, testing and deploying Windows applications and services in isolated containers. Once an application or service is put into a container, that image can be distributed to testers, Beta users or any Spoon user by pushing the image to the Hub. This sections describes some of the building blocks of the Spoon platform starting with the virtual machine.
