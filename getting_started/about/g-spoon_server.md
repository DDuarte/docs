### Spoon Server

Spoon supports deployment to both [public](/hub) and private hub servers.

Spoon offers an on-premise soltuion called **Spoon Server** that allows your organization to host an internal hub. Any Windows machine can host this software. It provides the same functionality as the Spoon Hub, but hosted entirely on your organization's network.
