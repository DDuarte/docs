The [Hub](/hub) is the distribution component of Spoonium. Using the Hub you can store and share images that you have created. All Spoonium accounts allow for the creation of unlimited public repositories and can be [upgraded](/pricing) to create private repositories on the Hub.

## Creating a Profile

To use the Hub, you need a profile! [Sign up](http://spoon.net/sso/spoonium.net/register) for a Spoonium account or log in with your existing Spoon.net account information.

Once your account is created, go to your [account settings](/account) to add your avatar, Twitter URL and GitHub URL so that your friends will recognize you.

### Are you working with a team?

If you are working with a group of collaborators, [create an organization](/pricing#organization) to simplify the management of the repository.

The owner of the organization can add or remove users and manage the organization's subscription from the [settings](/hub) page.

Similar to individual accounts, organizations may have unlimited public repositories, and can be [upgraded](/pricing#organization) for private repositories.
